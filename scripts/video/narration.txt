Welcome to Lendgismo — a complete, zero‑code asset‑based lending platform that you fully own.

Let’s walk through the experience end‑to‑end.

We’ll start with the landing pages. Use these out of the box or plug in your own website and keep our login — your choice.

Now let’s sign in. You can use demo credentials, or sign up and try it live. Multi‑factor is built‑in using your own Twilio and SendGrid keys.

After sign‑in you land on the dashboard. Here you’ll see analytics, applications in flight, portfolio performance and quick actions.

Open any application to review the details, approve or decline, and collaborate with your team. Borrowers are guided through a streamlined invite flow to upload files and securely link bank data with Plaid — just add your Plaid keys.

As applications move forward, convert them into borrowers and monitor clients over time. View documents, preview, download or remove them as needed.

Tasks help your team stay on track. Use the Kanban board to assign owners, set due dates and move work forward.

Reporting is flexible: generate on‑demand or schedule recurring reports for anything in the platform.

Analytics break down portfolio health, risk, benchmarks and projections with clean, informative charts.

In Account Settings, manage users and fine‑grained permissions. Two‑factor security is available using your own provider keys. Billing integrates with Stripe if you’d like to invoice clients.

Customize branding — logos, colors and landing options — so everything matches your identity.

Add users, choose Admin or User roles, and give each person exactly the access they need.

API Keys centralize your credentials for Plaid, Twilio, SendGrid and Stripe. Add your keys once and you’re set.

The Activity Log shows what’s happening across the platform so Admins get the full picture while individual users see only their own work.

Notifications surface important events, and global search lets you jump to any borrower in seconds.

There’s also a guided tour you can run anytime to explore the app at your pace.

Everything you just saw can be fully branded and configured for your business.

This is Lendgismo. You own this code. When you’re ready, request a handoff and we’ll get you live.
